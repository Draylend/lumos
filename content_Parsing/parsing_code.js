class code_parsing extends ActiveChat 
{
    /*steps: 
        1) go through each and every line in active chat and find out which parts start in '<' and end in '>'
        2) based on the parts that it starts and ends in, separate them and mark them as part of a separate variable
        3) no need to render yet in the chatbox, but make sure that they are separate 


        pseudocode: 
        1. parse markdown into some intermediate format
        2. create a function to determine which texts are parsed 
            for every node:
                if the node contains the tags
                {
                    extract the node and add it to an empty set for parsed blocks
                }
                else
                {
                    keep them within the text-block set
                }
        3. create a code for finding out the things that are in between
